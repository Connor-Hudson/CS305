# CS305

For this assignment, I assumed the role of a developer for a software engineering company, Global Rain.

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates personalized financial plans for their clients, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. As a part of modernizing their operations, they sought Global Rain's expertise in identifying security vulnerabilities in their web-based software application. The issue that they wanted us to address was to identify and document security vulnerabilities in their RESTful web application programming interface (API).

During the vulnerability assessment, I was able to conduct a manual review and static testing, which helped me identify security vulnerabilities in the software application. This is important because coding securely ensures that the software application can protect sensitive data, maintain the company's reputation, and prevent financial loss or legal penalties resulting from a data breach. Secure software development is an essential aspect of a company's overall well-being as it protects not only the company but also their clients.

One of the most challenging parts of the vulnerability assessment was identifying all the vulnerabilities in the code manually. However, using the static testing method helped me identify additional vulnerabilities that I may not have found through manual review.

To increase the layers of security, I suggested various security measures, such as authentication and authorization, encryption, and input validation. In the future, I would use a combination of manual review, static testing, and dynamic testing to assess vulnerabilities and decide on which mitigation techniques to use.

In this assignment, I reviewed the Project One Code Base, and utilized the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, and the Maven Dependency-Check Plug-in to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. These resources, tools, and secure coding practices would be helpful in future assignments or tasks related to software development.

To show future employers my skills, knowledge, and experience, I would provide them with my vulnerability assessment report, which includes a summary of the vulnerabilities I found, the areas of security that apply to the software application, a description of where the vulnerabilities were found, and a mitigation plan. This report showcases my ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities and demonstrates my expertise in secure software development.
